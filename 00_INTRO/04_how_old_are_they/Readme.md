# 👥 Age Tracker - Family & Friends Edition

This is a fun and simple Python script that calculates and displays the ages of five fictional individuals based on logical relationships between their ages.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand variable assignment and arithmetic operations in Python.
- Practice string formatting using multi-line `f-strings`.
- Build a mini character profile using calculated data.

---

## 📐 Age Logic Breakdown

- `Anton` is **21** years old.
- `Beth` is 6 years older than Anton.
- `Chen` is 20 years older than Beth.
- `Drew` is the sum of Chen and Anton’s ages.
- `Ethan` is the same age as Chen.

All ages are calculated using variable relationships, not hardcoded values.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Anton_age = 21
Beth_age = Anton_age + 6
Chen_age = Beth_age + 20
Drew_age = Chen_age + Anton_age
Ethan_age = Chen_age

The program then prints all the ages in a clean, readable format.
