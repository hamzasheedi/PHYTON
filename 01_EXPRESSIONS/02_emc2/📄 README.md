# Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence 💡⚛️

This Python program calculates the energy (E) equivalent of a given mass (m) using Einstein’s famous formula:

E = m * c²

Where:
- `E` is the energy in joules
- `m` is the mass in kilograms
- `c` is the speed of light (≈ 299,792,458 m/s)

## 🧠 What It Does

1. Prompts the user to enter mass in kilograms.
2. Applies the formula `E = m * c²`.
3. Displays the energy in joules along with a formula explanation.

## 🧪 Example Output

=== Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence ===

Enter mass in kilograms (kg): 2

E = 1.7975103574736357e+17 joules of energy!

Formula used: E = m * c² (E stands for energy, m for mass, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum)
