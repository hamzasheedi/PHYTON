# Division Calculator ➗

This Python program takes two numbers as input and calculates:

- The **quotient** (result of division)
- The **remainder** (what’s left over)

## 🔢 How It Works

1. User is asked to enter two numbers.
2. The program performs division:
   - `Quotient = First Number ÷ Second Number`
   - `Remainder = First Number % Second Number`
3. Outputs both results with proper formatting.

## 🧠 Example Output
