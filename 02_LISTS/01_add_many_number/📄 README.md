# 🔢 Sum of Comma-Separated Numbers

This Python program allows the user to input a list of numbers separated by commas, and it calculates the total **sum**.

## 🧠 What It Does

1. Accepts a user input string like `1, 2, 3.5`
2. Splits it into a list of numbers using `.split(',')`
3. Converts each number to `float`
4. Calculates and displays the total sum

## 💡 Example

=== Sum of Numbers from a Comma-Separated List ===

Enter numbers separated by commas (e.g. 1, 2, 3): 4.5, 2.1, 3.4

The total sum of the numbers is: 10.0

=== Sum of Numbers from a Comma-Separated List ===

Enter numbers separated by commas (e.g. 1, 2, 3): 4.5, 2.1, 3.4

The total sum of the numbers is: 10.0
