# 🔚 Get Last Element from a List

This script allows users to enter a series of inputs and then **prints the last element** that was entered — either after all inputs or if the user presses Enter to stop early.

---

## 🚀 What This Script Teaches

- Creating and working with lists in Python
- Using `for` loops with conditional exits
- Grabbing the last element from a list (`my_list[-1]`)
- Input validation and error handling

---

## 🧪 Example Output

🔢 How many elements do you want to enter?

4 Enter element 1 (or press Enter to stop early): book

Enter element 2 (or press Enter to stop early): pen

Enter element 3 (or press Enter to stop early): laptop

Enter element 4 (or press Enter to stop early):

✅ Your last entered element is: laptop



---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file called `get_last_element.py`
2. Run the script:
python get_last_element.py

---

##📌 Notes
If the user presses Enter without typing anything, the program stops early and returns the last entered item.

If nothing was entered at all, it notifies the user.

Input is treated as strings.

## 🛠 Requirements
Python 3.x

---

## 💡 Challenges to Try
Get both the first and last element.

Let users enter numbers and return the max/min.

Limit duplicates or sort before returning the last element.
